          <h5>Overview</h5>
          <p>
            Our Capstone team is working with Praxis Impact, a technology consulting company, to develop an experiential learning (e.g., client-based projects, case study simulations, internships, and service-based learning) platform for educational institutions, job training programs, and enterprise-class business environments. Our team is building upon the previous capstone team's prototype and research to create a CRM platform. The goal is to make it easier for university organizations to manage student experiential learning projects, while considering scalability and customizability.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            This project is part of my graduate human-computer interaction capstone course. I served as sprint master for the first sprint and lead visual designer on the second sprint.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Experiential learning is loose term used to signify learning through practical experience. Some examples of this type of learning are client-based projects, case study simulations, internships, and service-based learning. Instructors or program directors that utilize experiential learning need to maintain positive relationships with contacts in order to supply projects and other experiential learning opportunities for their students. In order to maintain these relationships, some use CRM platforms, like Salesforce and Active Campaign, while others prefer to use Google Suites, but these existing platforms have gaps in where they meet their users, like in data management, file sharing, and workflow management. Many of these problems come from issues with users having models of their workflow and information architecture that conflict with the inflexible models presented by existing platforms. Managing experiential learning programs becomes exponentially more difficult at scale, where these gaps and conflicts become more egregious. Our platform seeks to address these issues.

          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Since our team had little experience working with CRM software or managing experiential learning programs, we began by conducting a competitive analysis and user research to develop models that would accurately describe the problem space to not only help our own understanding but also highlight key insights that our client had not yet considered.

          <h2>Initial User Interviews</h2>
          <p>
            After conducting our competitive analysis, our team conducted user testing with three members of the University of Marylan's iConsultancy using semi-structured interview to better understand how managers of experiential learning platforms manage client relationships, focusing on their workflow and tools. After our interviews, we used affinity mapping to synthesize our thoughts and generate insights.

          <p>
            Our team used the insights we generated during our affinity diagramming to generate sketches. We determined that we would focus on developing an onboarding wizard for users setting up the workflow for their experiential learning platform because the interface for day-to-day client management would depend on the inputs put in at startup.

          <h2>Low-Fidelity Wireframing</h2>
          <p>
            From our sketches, our team generated a mid-fidelity prototype of the onboarding wizard. The wizard consisted of several steps: initial questions, nomenclature personalization, workflow builder, and data management system setup. We thought to use the user's answers to the initial questions to generate a custom framework of nomenclature and workflow. This design focused on allowing the user flexibility to edit the terminology in each aspect of the system. Our thinking was that this would align with the user need of dissatisfaction with the flexibility of existing systems. At this stage, we largely thought about each part of the onboarding process as individual elements in the design, which presented issues during our user testing.

          <h2>User Testing and Further User Research</h2>
          <p>
            After testing our prototype with more individuals involved with experiential learning programs at University of Maryland, we determined that we needed to take a step back and reevaluate what kind of data our onboarding wizard would need to process and how different types of users with their existing workflows and nomenclature would interact with our wizard.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            Our team conducted user testing with three participants using semi-structured interview to better understand how managers of experiential learning platforms manage client relationships, focusing on their workflow and tools. Our participants all manage different experiential learning programs at the University of Maryland.
          </p>
            
          <p>
            After our interviews, we used affinity mapping to synthesize our thoughts and generate insights. We then used the information we gleaned during our research to create diagrams modeling the problem space. We developed two personas based on our participant data to help our client better understand the target user of our design. We also developed collaboration models and workflow models based on our participant data. Based on this data, I developed a diagram detailing what data our software would need to collect and how it might go about doing so, which I used to create a user flow diagram that would guide our team as we worked on our prototype.

          <h2>Data Collection Diagram</h2>
          <p>
            From our user research, our team uncovered that nomenclature is extremely important to our users during each step of their process. Beyond causing discomfort, mismatches in nomenclature cause users to ignore, avoid, or skip over features in the software that would otherwise benefit them. To avoid having these mismatches in nomenclature, it is important for our software to not only have the flexibility to make changes to nomenclature but also to seamlessly interpret user inputs to make accurate judgments about what workflows would best fit with certain users. To that end, I created a data collection diagram to determine what kind of data about our users would be essential for our software to function and how that data could be gleaned.

          <p>
            Exploring diverse user perspectives beyond your primary client enriches insights. The design process is non-linear. You  may have to revisit the mapping stage to better understand the problem. Presenting unfinished work to the client can actually be quite valuable, as long as the justification is clear.
